## Technologies

👉 Bootstrap 5

## Implementation Remarks

1️⃣ I have added to the project 3 main components types that will help me perform the task in a simpler:

1. Welcome Page - A component that will greet users and provide a brief introduction to the website or application.
2. Catalog Page - A component that will display a comprehensive list of products or services offered by the website or application.
3. Shopping Cart Page - A component that will allow users to add products or services to a virtual shopping cart before proceeding to checkout. It will also display the total cost of the items in the cart.

2️⃣ I used the routing library 'react-router-dom' version v6.

3️⃣ I used the js-cookie library to save the items in the cookie memory.

4️⃣ I used Vite to create my react application (instead of CRA).
